## Summary

`inline-loops.macro` is a babel macro that will inline calls to the iteration methods provided, replacing them with `for` loops (or `for-in` in the case of objects). While this adds more code, it is also considerably more performant than the native versions of these methods. When working in non-JIT environments this is also faster than equivalent runtime helpers, as it avoids function calls and inlines operations when possible.

This is inspired by the work done on [babel-plugin-loop-optimizer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-loop-optimizer), but aims to be both more targeted and more full-featured. Rather than globally replace all native calls, the use of macros allow a controlled, opt-in usage. This macro also supports decrementing array and object iteration, as well as nested usage.

You can use it for everything, only for hotpaths, as a replacement for `lodash` with legacy support, whatever you see fit for your project. The support should be the same as the support for `babel-plugin-macros`.

## Usage

```javascript
import { map, reduce, someObject } from 'inline-loops.macro';

function contrivedExample(array) {
    const doubled = map(array, (value) => value * 2);
    const doubleObject = reduce(doubled, (object, value) => ({
      ...object,
      [value]: value
    }, {});

    if (someObject(doubleObject, (value) => value > 100)) {
        console.log('I am large!');
    }
}
```

  - `everyRight` => same as `every`, but iterating in reverse
  - `everyObject` => same as `every` but iterating over objects intead of arrays
- `filter` ([MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter))
  - `filterRight` => same as `filter`, but iterating in reverse
  - `filterObject` => same as `filter` but iterating over objects intead of arrays

  - `findRight` => same as `find`, but iterating in reverse
  - `findObject` => same as `find` but iterating over objects intead of arrays
- `findIndex` ([MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/findIndex))

## How it works

Internally Babel will transform these calls to their respective loop-driven alternatives. Example

```javascript
// this
const foo = map(array, fn);

// becomes this
let _result = [];

for (let _key = 0, _length = array.length, _value; _key < _length; ++_key) {
  _value = array[_key];
  _result.push(fn(_value, _key, array));
}

const foo = _result;
```

If you are passing uncached values as the array or the handler, it will store those values as local variables and execute the same loop based on those variables.

### Aggressive inlining

One extra performance boost is that `inline-loops` will try to inline the callback operations when possible. For example:

```javascript
// this
const doubled = map(array, value => value * 2);

// becomes this
let _result = [];

for (let _key = 0, _length = array.length, _value; _key < _length; ++_key) {
  _value = array[_key];
  _result.push(_value * 2);
}

const doubled = _result;
```

Notice that there is no reference to the original function, because it used the return directly. This even works with nested calls!

```javascript
// this
const isAllTuples = every(array, tuple => every(tuple, value => Array.isArray(value) && value.length === 2));

// becomes this
let _result = true;

for (let _key = 0, _length = array.length, _value; _key < _length; ++_key) {
  _value = array[_key];

  let _result2 = true;

  for (let _key2 = 0, _length2 = _value.length, _value2; _key2 < _length2; ++_key2) {
    _value2 = _value[_key2];

    if (!(Array.isArray(_value2) && _value2.length === 2)) {
      _result2 = false;
      break;
    }
  }

  if (!_result2) {
    _result = false;
    break;
  }
}

const isAllTuples = _result;
```

### Bailout scenarios

Inevitably not everything can be inlined, so there are known bailout scenarios:

- When using a cached function reference (we can only inline functions that are statically declared in the macro scope)
- When there are multiple `return` statements (as there is no scope to return from, the conversion of the logic would be highly complex)
- When the `return` statement is not top-level (same reason as with multiple `return`s)

That means if you are cranking every last ounce of performance out of this macro, you want to get cozy with ternaries.

```js
import { map } from 'inline-loops.macro';

// this will bail out to storing the function and calling it in the loop
const deopted = map(array, value => {
  if (value % 2 === 0) {
    return 'even';
  }

  return 'odd';
});

// this will inline the operation and avoid function calls
const inlined = map(array, value => (value % 2 === 0 ? 'even' : 'odd'));
```

## Gotchas

Some aspects of implementing this macro that you should be aware of:

### Conditionals do not delay execution

If you do something like this with standard JS:

```js
return isFoo ? array.map(v => v * 2) : array;
```

The `array` is only mapped over if `isFoo` is true. However, because we are inlining these calls into `for` loops in the scope they operate in, this conditional calling does not apply with this macro.

```js
// this
return isFoo ? map(array, v => v * 2) : array;

// turns into this
let _result = [];

for (let _key = 0, _length = array.length, _value; _key < _length; ++_key) {
  _value = array[_key];
  _result[_key] = _value * 2;
}

return isFoo ? _result : array;
```

Notice the mapping occurs whether the condition is met or not. If you want to ensure this conditionality is maintained, you should use an `if` block instead:

```js
// this
if (isFoo) {
  return map(array, v => v * 2);
}

return array;

// turns into this
if (isFoo) {
  let _result = [];

  for (let _key = 0, _length = array.length, _value; _key < _length; ++_key) {
    _value = array[_key];
    _result[_key] = _value * 2;
  }

  return _result;
}

return array;
```

This will ensure the potentially expensive computation only occurs when necessary.

### `*Object` methods do not perform `hasOwnProperty` check

The object methods will do operations in `for-in` loop, but will not guard via a `hasOwnProperty` check. For example:

```javascript
// this
const doubled = mapObject(object, value => value * 2);

// becomes this
let _result = {};

let _value;

for (let _key in object) {
  _value = object[_key];
  _result[key] = _value * 2;
}

const doubled = _result;
```

This works in a vast majority of cases, as the need for `hasOwnProperty` checks are often an edge case; it only matters when using objects created via a custom constructor, iterating over static properties on functions, or other non-standard operations. `hasOwnProperty` is a slowdown, but can be especially expensive in legacy browsers or non-JIT environments.

If you need to incorporate this, you can do it one of two ways:

**Add filtering (iterates twice, but arguably cleaner semantics)**

```javascript
const raw = mapObject(object, (value, key) => (object.hasOwnProperty(key) ? value * 2 : null));
const doubled = filterObject(raw, value => value !== null);
```

**Use reduce instead (iterates only once, but a little harder to grok)**

```javascript
const doubled = reduceObject(object, (_doubled, value, key) => {
  if (object.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
    _doubled[key] = value * 2;
  }

  return _doubled;
});
```

### `findIndex` vs `findKey`

Most of the operations follow the same naming conventions:

- `{method}` (incrementing array)
- `{method}Right` (decrementing array)
- `{method}Object` (object)

The exception to this is `findIndex` / `findIndexRight` (which are specific to arrays) and `findKey` (which is specific to objects). The rationale should be obvious (arrays only have indices, objects only have keys), but because it is the only exception to the rule I wanted to call it out.
